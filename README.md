## **WiseConnect**

*Bridging the digital divide for older adults, one connection at a time.*

# **Inspiration**

I got inspired to create WiseConnect after watching my grandparents struggle with super basic tech stuff. Things like opening an email, joining a video call, or even adjusting the volume on their phone felt like a whole mission for them.

Since I grew up around technology, it hit me how easy it is for teens like me to forget that older adults never had the same exposure. Every new app or update can feel confusing or intimidating for them.

I wanted to build something that helps them learn tech at their own pace and feel confident again. Basically, I wanted to make a tool that brings generations closer instead of leaving seniors behind in the digital dust.

# **What it does:**

WiseConnect is a simple learning platform made for older adults who want to get better at using technology.

It includes:

Personalized learning paths

Their lessons are based on what they already know and how they like to learn.

Accessibility features

Like text-to-speech, voice navigation, large buttons, and high contrast for easier visibility.

A friendly community section

A place where seniors can ask questions or connect with others.

A very clean and easy design

No clutter, no tiny buttons, no confusing menus. Just straight-up simple stuff.

The goal is to help them feel more confident and connected, not stressed or left out.

# **How I built it:**

I broke the project down into small parts so it would be easier to build:

Research

I checked data from the U.S. Census Bureau and WHO to understand how big the digital divide really is. I also talked to older adults around me to learn what exactly they struggle with.

MVP planning

I decided the first version needed:

A simple onboarding quiz
Two or three basic lessons
A progress bar to motivate users
Design work
I created mockups with large text, clean layouts, and simple navigation. I also added voice features to make the lessons easier to follow.

Development

I spent a large amount of time to focus on research and make sure that all the details and features which could help older adults were present. The lessons in the app would be focused on:

Making an email account
Starting a video call
Learning essential apps
Testing plans
I planned to test with around 10 to 15 seniors and measure success like this:


# **Challenges I ran into:**

Building for older adults was way tougher than I expected:

Accessibility is super tricky.
You have to think about tiny details like text spacing, button size, and how many steps each action takes.

Getting feedback took time.
Seniors move at their own pace, which meant testing and adjusting the design was slow.

Balancing simplicity and personalization.
I wanted it to be customized but not overwhelming.

Making sure they actually want to try it.
Some seniors are kind of scared of new tech, so motivating them was a challenge.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of:

Creating a platform that actually helps solve a real problem for real people.
Designing a super clean, accessible interface that older adults can use without stress.
Adding voice assistance and large, easy-to-read elements.
Planning the MVP and setting goals that make sense for beginners.
Making something that could genuinely help seniors feel more confident and independent.
Honestly, seeing it come together felt pretty awesome.

# **What I learned**

This project taught me a lot, not just about tech:

Simple design is way harder than it looks.
You have to think like your users, not yourself.
Seniors aren’t bad with tech, they just never had the chance to learn it.
Privacy and security matter a lot for older adults.
Testing with real users is super important, even if it takes extra time.
I also learned that good design isn’t about making things fancy. It is about making things usable.

What's next for WiseConnect
I want to keep building WiseConnect into something really useful.

# **Here are the next steps:**

More lessons
Including online banking, telehealth, scam safety, and browsing the internet.

Mentor matching
Pairing seniors with volunteers who can guide them.

Language support
So people in different regions can learn comfortably.

Fun rewards
Simple achievements to keep motivation up.

Partnerships
With senior centers, NGOs, and community groups.

My goal is to make WiseConnect a tool that helps older adults stay connected, confident, and independent. And honestly, I hope it becomes something that makes their lives feel a little easier and a little less lonely.
