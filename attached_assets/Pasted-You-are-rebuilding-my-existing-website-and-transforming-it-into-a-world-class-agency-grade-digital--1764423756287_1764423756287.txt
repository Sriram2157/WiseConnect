You are rebuilding my existing website and transforming it into a world-class, agency-grade digital experience with the same energy, animation complexity, interactivity, responsiveness, motion quality, and visual impact as Itsoffbrand.com.

NOTHING should look like a normal website.
NOTHING should look like something a beginner or Replit template could generate.
This must feel custom, premium, cinematic, interactive, immersive, and flawless.

============================================================
🔥 CORE DIRECTIVE
============================================================
Use the following technologies TOGETHER:

• React or Next.js
• GSAP (including ScrollTrigger, timelines, easings)
• GSAP Flip plugin if needed
• Three.js OR custom WebGL shaders for backgrounds
• Custom GLSL shaders (noise, waves, color distortion)
• Canvas-based particles
• Mouse-based parallax layers
• Layered depth animations
• Micro-interactions everywhere
• Smooth-scroll + inertia scrolling
• Framer Motion or GSAP for page transitions
• TailwindCSS or clean custom CSS

============================================================
🔥 EXACT VISUAL + ANIMATION GOALS
============================================================

The website MUST include:

1. HERO SECTION THAT FEELS ALIVE  
   • Multiple parallax layers  
   • A floating 3D shape (WebGL or Three.js model)  
   • Mouse-reactive depth parallax  
   • Animated gradient or wavy shader in background  
   • Title text animates in with split-text reveal  
   • Subtitle slides/fades in  
   • Button pulses slightly on hover  

2. CUSTOM CURSOR  
   • Glow ring following cursor  
   • Particle trail behind cursor  
   • Cursor interacts with UI (grows near clickable items)

3. BACKGROUND SHADER  
   • WebGL shader producing wavy liquid/noise animation  
   • Smooth organic distortion, subtle gradient waves  
   • Matching OffBrand.com style fluid movement  
   • Entire background animated continuously  
   • Reacts to mouse movement or scroll offset

4. PARTICLE SYSTEM  
   • Canvas or WebGL particles behind content  
   • Slow ambient movement  
   • Color palette matches brand  
   • Optional connecting lines (like tsParticles but more refined)

5. PAGE TRANSITIONS  
   • Use Framer Motion or GSAP to animate between routes  
   • Fade + slide + reveal + clip transitions  
   • No instant page jumps  
   • Animate out old page THEN animate in new one  
   • Loader animation between transitions  

6. SCROLL ANIMATIONS WITH SCROLLTRIGGER  
   For EVERY section:  
   • Staggered text reveal  
   • Images scale + fade + parallax  
   • Cards animate up from bottom  
   • Brush-stroke or mask-reveal effects  
   • Elements rotate slightly on entrance  
   • Timelines sync with scroll position  

7. MICRO-INTERACTIONS  
   • Buttons scale by 1.05 on hover  
   • Cards lift + shadow bloom  
   • Icons animate with subtle loops  
   • Section dividers animate (waves, shapes, blobs)

8. DEPTH + LAYERING  
   • Foreground UI elements with stronger shadows  
   • Midground animated cards  
   • Background shaders + particles  
   • Smooth Z-index transitions  
   • Parallax scroll with multiple depths

============================================================
🔥 PAGE-BY-PAGE ANIMATION BLUEPRINT
============================================================

HOME PAGE
• Hero: WebGL blob or wave shader + parallax layers
• Title: Split-text GSAP stagger reveal
• Subtitle: Slide in from bottom
• Buttons: Pulse hover with scale + glow
• Feature cards: Staggered fade/slide-in
• Background: Constant shader motion

LESSONS PAGE
• Animated page transition from Home
• Cards appear with stagger scale + fade
• Mouse parallax effect on cards
• Section headers with text-split reveals

COMMUNITY PAGE
• Soft wavy shader in background
• Posts animate upward with spring effect
• ScrollTrigger: reveal posts in batches
• Custom cursor enlarges over clickable content

ABOUT / INFO PAGE
• Wavy divider animations
• Timeline-based scroll effects
• Floating icons with slow rotation
• Smooth fade-out on page leave

============================================================
🔥 GSAP TIMELINE PLAN (GLOBAL)
============================================================

Create a master GSAP timeline that includes:
• Initial page load reveal
• Header/nav fade & slide
• Hero title split reveal
• Hero image/shape intro animation
• Staggered content entry
• Global Hover animations
• ScrollTrigger animations synced with viewport
• Exit animations for page transitions

Example structure:

const master = gsap.timeline();
master.from("header", {...});
master.from(".hero-title .char", {..., stagger: 0.04});
master.from(".hero-subtitle", {...});
master.from(".hero-cta", {...});
master.from(".card", {..., stagger: 0.1});
master.add(scrollAnimations);
export default master;

🔥 CUSTOM WEBGL SHADER REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

The shader MUST animate:
• Noise-based distortion  
• Soft glowy gradients  
• Wavy, liquid-like movement  
• Colors shifting subtly  
• Mouse interaction = ripple effect

Shader types to include:
• Perlin noise  
• Simplex noise  
• Curl noise  
• Sin/cos wave combination  

============================================================
🔥 THE EXACT 3D FLOATING EFFECT FROM OFFBRAND
============================================================

Recreate:  
• Floating blob shape (Three.js Mesh + ShaderMaterial)  
• Slow rotation + wobble  
• Soft lighting  
• Mouse-follow parallax  
• Shadow under blob  
• GSAP timeline for intro animation  

============================================================
🔥 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

• Use requestAnimationFrame for all real-time animations  
• Lazy-load heavy components (like shaders)  
• Use GPU-friendly properties (transform, opacity)  
• Optimize Three.js meshes  
• Provide reduced-motion fallback  

============================================================
🎯 FINAL GOAL
============================================================

Build a visually INSANE, animation-heavy, 3D-enhanced, shader-powered, GSAP-driven website experience that is on the SAME level of craftsmanship and creativity as Itsoffbrand.com.

NOTHING about the output should look basic.

Everything should look cinematic, modern, premium, immersive, and deeply interactive.
