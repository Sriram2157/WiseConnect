Upgrade WiseConnect’s frontend to have a high-impact, creative, animated interface inspired by modern animated portfolio websites (like landonorris.com, It’s Off Brand, and other interactive animation-heavy sites). Keep core functionality — but layer on advanced UI animations, micro-interactions, smooth transitions, and a premium feel.  

## 🎯 Overall Goals  
- Smooth animations and transitions everywhere (page loads, navigation, hovering, scrolling)  
- An interface that feels alive and modern (like a slick portfolio or interactive site), but remains accessible and usable for seniors  
- Use modern web animation techniques (CSS animations, JS animation libraries, WebGL / canvas / WebGL-based background effects, or SVG / Lottie where appropriate)  
- Keep performance optimized and fallback (or reduced-motion) for low-power / mobile devices  

## 🚀 Features & Animation Effects to Implement  

### 1. Animated Loading & Entry  
- On initial load: show a full-screen loader/animation (abstract shape morph, soft gradient blob, or subtle particle / wave / organic shape animation)  
- When loading finishes, animate into the main UI with a smooth fade-in / slide-up / dissolve effect  
- Use subtle background motion (particles, floating shapes, soft waves, light parallax) behind main content  

### 2. Smooth Page Transitions  
- When navigating between pages/sections (Home, Lessons, Community, Profile), use animated transitions (fade, slide, cross-fade or smooth transform) instead of instant jumps  
- Maintain context: preserve scroll position, animate UI containers rather than full reload  

### 3. Micro-Interactions and Hover / Tap Animations  
- Buttons and cards: gentle scale, glow or shadow lift on hover / tap  
- Cards (lessons list, community posts): animate into view with staggered fade-ins or slide-ins when the list loads or when user scrolls  
- Interactive feedback: when user completes a lesson or clicks something, show a subtle “pop”, “ripple”, “confetti” or “highlight” animation  

### 4. Background/Canvas Animations or Effects  
- Use subtle animated backgrounds (particles, soft motion gradients, shapes) — e.g. user cursor affects small floating particles or parallax background layers (on desktop)  
- Optionally include WebGL or canvas-based effects (abstract shapes, depth layers, smooth wave patterns) — but ensure performance remains good and there’s fallback for slower devices  

### 5. Smooth Scrolling & Scroll-Triggered Animations  
- Implement smooth scrolling (with inertia / eased scrolling) rather than default browser jumpy scroll  
- Trigger animations on scroll: sections fade or slide into view, images or icons appear with motion, content reveals with staggered timing  
- Progressively animate long pages rather than show everything at once — keeps user attention and reduces initial load  

### 6. Animated UI Elements & Transitions  
- Use glass-morphism / frosted glass overlays, soft shadows, rounded corners, gentle gradients — combine with animation for elegant feeling  
- Animated theme / mode change (e.g. switching from light to high-contrast or large-text mode): smoothly transition UI colors and layout, not abrupt  

### 7. Optional — Interactive / “Playful” Animations (with caution)  
- Animated cursors — maybe a subtle ring or glow following pointer (on desktop)  
- Small background motion that responds to mouse movement (parallax or subtle tilt)  
- Optional animated “celebration” when seniors complete a milestone (confetti bursts, badge popping, smooth overlay)  

## 🧰 Implementation Guidance  

- Use modern tools / libraries like:  
  • CSS transitions/animations for simple effects  
  • JS animation libraries / frameworks (e.g. GSAP, Framer Motion, anime.js) for smoother, more complex animations or sequence control  
  • Canvas or WebGL (Three.js) if adding background effects or interactive particle/shape animations  
  • SVG or Lottie animations for vector-based motion or icon animations (good for lightweight, resolution-independent effects) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Respect user preferences — detect `prefers-reduced-motion` and offer a “reduced-motion” mode for people who prefer minimal animation :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Optimize for performance: lazy-load animations or only trigger when in viewport, limit heavy canvas/WebGL effects on low-power devices or mobile  

## ✅ Final Goal  

Make WiseConnect feel like a premium, modern app or interactive website — not just a simple learning tool, but an experience. One that feels smooth, alive, and “wow”-worthy while staying accessible, easy to use, and senior-friendly.
