Upgrade the existing WiseConnect app interface to have a clean, premium, Apple-esque design. Do not change the core functionality. Focus entirely on the visual style, motion, and overall feeling of smoothness.

## Design Style (Apple-Inspired)
- Use lots of spacing, soft gradients, gentle blurs, and smooth rounded corners.
- Add subtle glassmorphism effects (light frosted glass panels, translucent backgrounds).
- Use a calm, minimal color palette (whites, soft grays, light blues, gentle neutrals).
- Use high-quality typography similar to Apple’s design: San Francisco style or a clean modern sans-serif.
- Make the UI feel “airy” and breathable.

## Animations & Motion
Include animations inspired by iOS:
- Smooth page transitions (fade, slide, or dissolve).
- Button hover and tap animations with gentle scaling.
- Cards that subtly lift or glow on hover.
- A smooth spring animation when elements appear or pop in.
- Animated progress indicators with fluid movement.
- Staggered fade-ins for lists or modules.
- Smooth scrolling with inertia.

All animations must feel soft and elegant, not distracting.

## Components to Update Visually
1. **Navigation Bar**
   - Clean bottom tab bar with icons + labels.
   - Soft blur background to create a floating iOS-style effect.

2. **Lesson Cards**
   - Rounded corners (18–24px).
   - Slight shadow or depth.
   - Light hover animations that increase brightness or lift slightly.

3. **Buttons**
   - Large, rounded, smooth.
   - Glossy or slightly translucent styles.
   - Tap animation: subtle scale down + fade ripple.

4. **Progress Bar**
   - Smooth animated fill.
   - Soft gradient matching the theme.

5. **Community Page**
   - Messages appear with staggered fade-in.
   - Clean bubbles or card-style posts similar to iMessage or iOS notifications.

## Effects to Include
- Light frosted glass backgrounds for headers or toolbars.
- Subtle depth using layered shadows.
- Dynamic motion (elements slide in with spring easing).
- Gentle glow or shimmer effects for completion badges.
- Smooth hover states that look like iOS UI interactions.

## Code Guidance
- Use CSS transitions, keyframes, or a library like Framer Motion for smooth animations.
- Keep all interactions consistent with iOS design philosophy.
- Avoid harsh edges, sharp color contrasts, or fast, jarring animations.

## Final Goal
Make the app feel like a premium Apple product:
clean, smooth, modern, airy, animated, and visually delightful.
Keep everything intuitive for older adults while giving it a polished, world-class design.
